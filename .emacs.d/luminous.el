defined at the time the top-level form is evaluated, but will be
defined by time the sub-form's code is evaluated. This macro
handles its arguments in some way other than evaluating them
directly. And finally, one of the arguments of this macro could
be interpreted itself as a macro invocation, and expanding the

The reason we need this is that in order to enable auto-fill
globally, we are supposed to set the default value of variable
`auto-fill-function'. However, some major modes set
`normal-auto-fill-function' (itself normally set to
`do-auto-fill', which is what we generally set the default value
of variable `auto-fill-function' to), expecting `auto-fill-mode'
to be enabled afterwards (which copies the value of
`normal-auto-fill-function' into variable `auto-fill-function').
However, since we enable auto-fill globally by means of setting
variable `auto-fill-function' directly, this setting gets lost.
The workaround is to set variable `auto-fill-function' globally
to a function which looks up the value of
`normal-auto-fill-function' \(generally just `do-auto-fill') and
calls that. This is a slight inversion of the usual flow of
control and might make you slightly uncomfortable, but we'll just
